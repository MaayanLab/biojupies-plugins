RNAseq Data Analysis Plug-ins for BioJupies
================
Overview
----------------
BioJupies (http://biojupies.cloud) is a web server for the automated generation of interactive notebooks for RNA-seq data analysis in the cloud through a simple user interface.

To generate notebooks, BioJupies uses a modular set plug-ins for analysis of RNA-seq data. These plug-ins can perform a wide variety of different analyses, including heatmaps, differential gene expression, enrichment analysis, small molecule queries, and more.

The Plug-ins
----------------
BioJupies currently contains the following RNA-seq data analysis plug-ins:

| Plug-in Name | Description |
