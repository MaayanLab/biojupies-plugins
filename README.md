## What is BioJupies?
BioJupies is a web server which allows users to automatically generate Jupyter Notebooks from RNA-seq datasets through an intuitive interface, with no knowledge of coding required. It can be accessed for free from http://biojupies.cloud.

The main GitHub repository for the project is available at https://github.com/MaayanLab/biojupies. This repository is dedicated to storing RNA-seq data analysis plugins.

### What are BioJupies plugins?
BioJupies plugins are modular snippets of code which can analyze RNA-seq data and embed a wide variety of visualizations, interactive plots, or results in Jupyter Notebooks.

## What plugins are currently available?
----------------
The BioJupies RNA-seq analysis toolbox currently contains the following plugins:
