## What is BioJupies?
BioJupies is a web server which allows users to automatically generate Jupyter Notebooks from RNA-seq datasets through an intuitive interface, with no knowledge of coding required. It can be accessed for free from http://biojupies.cloud.

## What are BioJupies plugins?
BioJupies plugins are modular snippets of code which can analyze RNA-seq data and embed visualizations, interactive plots, or analysis results in Jupyter Notebooks.

Plugins may perform a variety of different analyses, ranging from exploratory data analysis visualizations, differential gene expression, clustering, enrichment analysis, and small molecule queries. A full list of the plugins available is displayed below.

BioJupies currently supports plugins written in Python 3 and R.
