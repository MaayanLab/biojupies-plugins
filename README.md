BioJupies Plug-ins
================
Overview
----------------
BioJupies (http://biojupies.cloud) is a web server for the automated generation of interactive notebooks for RNA-seq data analysis in the cloud through a simple user interface.

To generate notebooks, BioJupies uses a modular set plug-ins which analyze RNA-seq data and embed the results using interactive plots and data visualizations. Source code for all plug-ins is stored in this GitHub repository.

Source code for the BioJupies Jupyter Notebook generation server is available at: https://github.com/MaayanLab/biojupies.

The Plug-ins
----------------
The BioJupies RNA-seq analysis toolbox currently contains the following plug-ins:
