    "introduction": "Biological pathways are sequences of interactions between biochemical compounds which play a key role in determining cellular behavior. Databases such as KEGG, Reactome and WikiPathways contain a large number of associations between such pathways and genes. This information can be leveraged by Enrichr to identify the biological pathways which are over-represented in the up-regulated and down-regulated genes identified by comparing two groups of samples.",
    "methods": "Enrichment results were generated by analyzing the up-regulated and down-regulated gene sets using Enrichr. The following libraries were used for the analysis: KEGG_2016, Reactome_2016, WikiPathways_2016. Significant terms are determined by using a cut-off of p-value<0.1 after applying Benjamini-Hochberg correction. For more information on the methods used to perform the enrichment analysis, see the Enrichr section.",
    "result_description": "The Pathway Enrichment Analysis plug-in embeds interactive bar charts displaying the results of the pathway enrichment analysis generated using Enrichr. The x axis indicates the enrichment score for each term; significant terms are highlighted in bold. Results are grouped by library. Additional information about enrichment results is available by hovering over each bar",
