    "tool_description": "Identifies miRNAs whose targets are enriched in the differentially expressed genes",
    "introduction": "microRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA molecules which play a key role in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. Databases such as TargetScan and MiRTarBase contain a large number of associations between miRNAs and their targets. This information can be leveraged by Enrichr to identify the miRNAs whose targets are over-represented in the up-regulated and down-regulated genes identified by comparing two groups of samples.",
    "methods": "Enrichment results were generated by analyzing the up-regulated and down-regulated gene sets using Enrichr. The following libraries were used for the analysis: TargetScan_microRNA_2017, miRTarBase_2017. Significant results are determined by using a cut-off of p-value<0.1 after applying Benjamini-Hochberg correction. For more information on the methods used to perform the enrichment analysis, see the Enrichr section.",
    "result_description": "The miRNA Enrichment Analysis plug-in embeds browsable tables displaying the results of the miRNA enrichment analysis generated using Enrichr. Every row represents a miRNA; significant miRNAs are highlighted in bold. A. displays results generated using the TargetScan library, B. displays results generated using the miRTarBase library.",
