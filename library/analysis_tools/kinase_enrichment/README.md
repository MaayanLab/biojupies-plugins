================
Summary
----------------
Identifies protein kinases whose substrates are enriched in the differentially expressed genes

Introduction
----------------
Protein kinases are enzymes that modify other proteins by chemically adding phosphate groups. Databases such as KEA contain a large number of associations between kinases and their substrates. This information can be leveraged by Enrichr to identify the protein kinases whose substrates are over-represented in the up-regulated and down-regulated genes identified by comparing two groups of samples.

Results
----------------
The Kinase Enrichment Analysis plug-in embeds browsable tables displaying the results of the Protein Kinase (PK) enrichment analysis generated using Enrichr. Every row represents a PK; significant PKs are highlighted in bold. A displays results generated using KEA, indicating PKs whose experimentally validated substrates are enriched. C displays results generated using the ARCHS4 library, indicating PKs whose top coexpressed genes (according to the ARCHS4 dataset) are enriched.

Methods
----------------
Enrichment results were generated by analyzing the up-regulated and down-regulated gene sets using Enrichr. The following libraries were used for the analysis: KEA_2015, ARCHS4_Kinases_Coexp. Significant results are determined by using a cut-off of p-value<0.1 after applying Benjamini-Hochberg correction. For more information on the methods used to perform the enrichment analysis, see the Enrichr section.
