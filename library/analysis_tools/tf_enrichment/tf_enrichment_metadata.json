    "tool_description": "Identifies transcription factors whose targets are enriched in the differentially expressed genes",
    "introduction": "Transcription Factors (TFs) are proteins involved in the transcriptional regulation of gene expression. Databases such as ChEA and ENCODE contain a large number of associations between TFs and their transcriptional targets. This information can be leveraged by Enrichr to identify the transcription factors whose targets are over-represented in the up-regulated and down-regulated genes identified by comparing two groups of samples.",
    "methods": "Enrichment results were generated by analyzing the up-regulated and down-regulated gene sets using Enrichr. The following libraries were used for the analysis: ChEA_2016, ENCODE_TF_ChIP-seq_2015, ARCHS4_TFs_Coexp. Significant results are determined by using a cut-off of p-value<0.1 after applying Benjamini-Hochberg correction. For more information on the methods used to perform the enrichment analysis, see the Enrichr section.",
    "result_description": "The Transcription Factor Enrichment Analysis plug-in embeds scrollable tables displaying the results of the Transcription Factor (TF) enrichment analysis generated using Enrichr. Every row represents a TF; significant TFs are highlighted in bold. A and B display results generated using ChEA and ENCODE libraries, indicating TFs whose experimentally validated targets are enriched. C displays results generated using the ARCHS4 library, indicating TFs whose top coexpressed genes (according to the ARCHS4 dataset) are enriched.",
