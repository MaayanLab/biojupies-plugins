    "tool_description": "Identifies Gene Ontology terms which are enriched in the differentially expressed genes",
    "introduction": "Gene Ontology (GO) is a major bioinformatics initiative aimed at unifying the representation of gene attributes across all species. It contains a large collection of experimentally validated and predicted associations between genes and biological terms. This information can be leveraged by Enrichr to identify the biological processes, molecular functions and cellular components which are over-represented in the up-regulated and down-regulated genes identified by comparing two groups of samples.",
    "methods": "Enrichment results were generated by analyzing the up-regulated and down-regulated gene sets using Enrichr. The following libraries were used for the analysis: GO_Biological_Process_2017b, GO_Molecular_Function_2017b, GO_Cellular_Component_2017b. Significant terms are determined by using a cut-off of p-value<0.1 after applying Benjamini-Hochberg correction. For more information on the methods used to perform the enrichment analysis, see the Enrichr section.",
    "result_description": "The Gene Ontology Enrichment Analysis plug-in embeds interactive bar charts displaying the results of the Gene Ontology enrichment analysis generated using Enrichr. The x axis indicates the enrichment score for each term; significant terms are highlighted in bold. Results are grouped by library. Additional information about enrichment results is available by hovering over each bar",
